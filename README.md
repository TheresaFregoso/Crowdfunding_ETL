# Crowdfunding_ETL
Boot Camp Project 2 

This project centers around the concept of Extract, Transform and Load. 
In it, I practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, I created four CSV files and use the CSV file structure to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database. 

This repo contains the juypter notebook used for the ETL called ETL_Mini_Project, a resources folder that contains the .csv and starting Excel files, the sql schema for loading the created .csv files into a Postgres database, and and images folder that contains the documentaion of the data loaded into the a Postgres DB.

This project was made better with the assitance of ChatGPT to help with code errors, and constructing cleaner code.
